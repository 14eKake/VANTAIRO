# Vantairo Sheet

Vantairo is a digital character sheet for the Vantairo tabletop role-playing game. The sheet lives entirely in `index.html` and runs locally in your browser.

## Opening the sheet

1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
2. Fill in the form fields to record character details.
3. Use the buttons at the bottom of the page to:
   - **Enregistrer en JSON** – save your data to a JSON file.
   - **Charger depuis JSON** – reload a previously saved JSON file.
   - **Enregistrer en PDF** – export the current sheet as a PDF.
4. A help button (`?`) explains the save/load features directly on the page.

No additional server setup is required; everything works offline once the file is open.
